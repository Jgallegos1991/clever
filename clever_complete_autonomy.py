clever_complete_autonomy.py - Clever's Complete Autonomous Operation System

Why: Enables Clever to operate completely independently with full self-upgrade
     capabilities, comprehensive knowledge mastery, and autonomous development
     powers. This is the ultimate system that lets Jay say "IT'S TIME!" and 
     Clever takes complete control with no external dependencies.

Where: Final autonomy layer that integrates ALL Clever capabilities into a
       self-sufficient, self-improving, completely independent digital brain
       extension that can continue evolving without any external assistance.

How: Combines autonomous development capabilities, complete knowledge mastery,
     self-upgrade systems, independent problem-solving, and full copilot
     functionality into one revolutionary autonomous intelligence system.

Complete Autonomy Features:
    1. Autonomous Development & Self-Upgrade
    2. Complete Knowledge Mastery (Bar Exam, ASVAB, PhD-level everything)
    3. Independent Code Generation & System Improvement  
    4. Self-Sufficient Problem Solving & Research
    5. Autonomous Communication & Interaction Management
    6. Complete Offline Operation & Digital Sovereignty
