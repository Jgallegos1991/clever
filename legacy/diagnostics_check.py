"""Diagnostics Consistency Checker

Why: Provide a lightweight, offline-safe validation that key architectural
assertions documented in `docs/copilot_diagnostics.md` are still true in the
current working tree (offline guard present, single DB reference, diagnostics
file exists). This acts as an early drift detector before deeper CI.
Where: Invoked via `make diagnostics` (new Makefile target) and can be wired
into future pre-commit / CI workflows. Returns non-zero exit when a critical
rule is violated, enabling automated gating.
How: Performs static text scans instead of importing the whole app (avoids
side effects). Reads selective files and searches for required tokens.

Connects to:
    - app.py: Verifies `offline_guard.enable()` invocation
    - config.py: Ensures single `DB_PATH` definition (no alternates)
    - docs/copilot_diagnostics.md: Confirms existence + required headers

    Why: Original regex assumed a simple quoted literal assignment which broke

    os.environ.get("CLEVER_DB_PATH", str(ROOT_DIR / "clever.db")). We loosen
    detection to still enforce single definition and correct filename without
    over-parsing Python semantics.
    Where: Called inside diagnostics pre-flight to prevent unnoticed drift in
    storage location (single DB rule).
    How: Scans config.py for lines starting with 'DB_PATH' (ignoring leading
    whitespace) and counts them; validates 'clever.db' substring is present on
    that line. Avoids executing code or AST parsing to remain trivial & offline.
