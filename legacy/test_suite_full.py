"""
Legacy comprehensive test suite (archived).

Why: The previous monolithic test suite contained mixed concerns and unstable
     dependencies; it is archived to avoid blocking CI while preserving history.
Where: Use pytest-based tests in tests/ going forward; run via `pytest` or
       `python run_tests.py` which now delegates primarily to pytest.
How: This file serves as a record of location only; no runtime usage.

Connects to:
    - tests/: Modern pytest-based test suite
    - run_tests.py: Current test runner interface
    - test_suite.py: Minimal test suite shim

"""Legacy test_suite with invalid syntax preserved for audit trail."""
