Clever's Comprehensive Academic Knowledge Engine

Why: Extend Clever's intelligence beyond basic vocabulary to include deep academic knowledge
     across mathematics, sciences, social studies, history, and grammar for true educational partnership
Where: Integrates with nlp_processor.py and persona.py for intelligent academic responses
How: Structured knowledge domains with hierarchical topic organization, fact databases,
     and educational response templates for comprehensive cognitive enhancement

Purpose:
    - Provide Clever with university-level knowledge across all major academic domains
    - Enable sophisticated educational conversations and tutoring capabilities
    - Support deep academic analysis and research assistance
    - Transform Clever into a true digital brain extension for learning

Connects to:
    - nlp_processor.py: Enhanced topic detection and academic concept analysis
    - persona.py: Educational response generation with domain expertise
    - evolution_engine.py: Academic learning progression and knowledge retention
