"""
File Inventory Generator

Why: To automatically create a markdown file (`file-inventory.md`) that provides
     a statistical overview of the project's files. This helps in understanding
     the project's composition, such as which file types are most common.
Where: This is a standalone utility script, typically run from the command line
       or via a `make` command (`make file-inventory`). It is not imported by
       other parts of the Clever application.
How: It walks through the project directory, collects statistics (count, lines of
     code, size) for each file extension, and gets the last modification date for
     each file. It then formats this information into a markdown table and writes
     it to `file-inventory.md`.

Connects to:
    - (None): This script is self-contained and does not import or interact with other custom modules from the Clever project.
