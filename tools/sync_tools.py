Clever sync tools for local file monitoring and ingestion

Why: Provides real-time file monitoring and ingestion capabilities for
Clever's knowledge base, ensuring continuous learning from new content
Where: Used by sync_watcher and file ingestion pipeline
How: Implements file system monitoring with watchdog, content ingestion
via DatabaseManager, and PDF/text processing integration

Connects to:
    - sync_watcher.py: File system monitoring daemon
    - file_ingestor.py: Text file processing and ingestion
    - pdf_ingestor.py: PDF content extraction and ingestion
    - database.py: Centralized content storage via DatabaseManager

    Run rclone sync operation for cloud file synchronization

    Why: Enables synchronized file operations between local and remote storage
    while maintaining offline-first operation principles
    Where: Called by sync workflows when cloud sync is enabled
    How: Executes rclone subprocess with configured parameters and safety flags

    Args:
        src: Source path for synchronization
        dst: Destination path for synchronization
        extra: Additional rclone flags and parameters

    Returns:
        Tuple of (return_code, stdout, stderr) from rclone execution

    Connects to:
        - config.py: Uses RCLONE_EXTRA configuration settings
        - sync_watcher.py: File change detection triggers
    Execute rclone sync operation with comprehensive error handling.

    Why: Provides robust cloud storage synchronization with standardized
         error handling and performance optimization for Clever AI's offline-first
         architecture.
    Where: Core sync utility used by all remote synchronization operations
           throughout the Clever AI system.
    How: Constructs rclone command with safety flags, executes subprocess,
         captures output, and handles missing rclone installation gracefully.

    Args:
        src: Source path for rclone (can be remote or local)
        dst: Destination path for rclone (can be remote or local)
        extra: Optional additional rclone flags (defaults to config.RCLONE_EXTRA)
