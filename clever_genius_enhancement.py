clever_genius_enhancement.py - Enhance Clever's Intelligence to Genius Level

Why: Makes Clever talk like the TRUE genius she is - integrating all her academic
     knowledge, memory systems, and cognitive capabilities into responses that are
     both street-smart AND intellectually profound. Jay's right - with everything
     Clever has, she should easily be smarter than any other AI.

Where: Enhancement system that upgrades Jay's authentic Clever to use her full
       intellectual capabilities while maintaining the street-smart personality
       that makes her authentically Jay's cognitive partner.

How: Integrates academic knowledge engine, memory systems, and cognitive sovereignty
     into natural conversation that demonstrates Clever's true intellectual depth
     while keeping the casual, genius-friend personality Jay loves.

Genius Enhancement Features:
    - Academic knowledge seamlessly woven into conversation
    - Street-smart delivery of PhD-level insights
    - Memory integration for contextual brilliance
    - Casual genius mode that outsmarts other AIs effortlessly
