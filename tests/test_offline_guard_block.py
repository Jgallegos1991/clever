Test: Offline guard blocks outbound network connections.

Why: Ensures Rule #1 (Strictly Offline) is actually enforced at runtime, not just by policy documentation.
Where: Uses `utils.offline_guard.enable()` then attempts to open an external socket (e.g., to example.com) which should fail.
How: Patch socket to enforce blocking (implemented by offline_guard). We try a simple connection; success would mean a failure of enforcement. The test asserts an exception is raised.

Connects to:
    - utils/offline_guard.py: The enforcement logic hooking socket / requests
    - app.py: Calls offline_guard.enable() during startup

    Validate that after enabling offline guard, outbound connections are blocked.
