"""Tests for runtime introspection endpoint.

Why: Ensure the new /api/runtime_introspect endpoint surfaces render events and
Why/Where/How route metadata so regressions are caught early.
Where: Part of automated test suite executed in CI along with UI acceptance
checks and docstring coverage enforcement.
How: Uses Flask test client to hit home (trigger a render) then queries
introspection endpoint and validates expected structural keys.

Connects to:
    - introspection.py: Runtime introspection functionality
    - app.py: Flask application and /api/runtime_introspect endpoint
    - pytest: Testing framework and fixtures
