"""Sentiment consistency test suite

Why: Ensure sentiment analysis remains stable and predictable across common polarity patterns.
Where: Validates nlp_processor + persona integration indirectly (uses PersonaEngine.generate which pulls sentiment from analysis).
How: Feed representative positive, negative, neutral sentences and assert classification alignment with expectations with some tolerance.

Connects to:
    - nlp_processor.py: Provides sentiment processing
    - persona.py: Surfaces sentiment field in PersonaResponse
