"""Test that runtime introspection exposes reasoning_graph with nodes and edges.

Why: Ensure graph backend feature (reasoning + optional concept graph) is present so frontend debug overlay can rely on stable contract.
Where: Part of tests/ executed in CI before deployment; touches /api/runtime_introspect endpoint.
How: Uses Flask test client to query endpoint and assert minimal shape & required keys.

Connects to:
    - introspection.py: Runtime graph generation and reasoning system
    - app.py: /api/runtime_introspect endpoint functionality
    - Frontend debug overlay: Graph visualization requirements
    - pytest: Testing framework and Flask test client
