"""
Test Suite for Sanitizer Functions

Why: To ensure that the text sanitization functions, which are critical for
     cleaning AI-generated output before it's presented to the user, are
     working correctly. This prevents internal metadata or undesirable
     artifacts from leaking into the final response.
Where: This test module is part of the project's test suite and is executed
       during automated testing (e.g., via `make test`). It specifically
       targets the `_sanitize_persona_text` function.
How: It defines a series of test cases with sample raw text containing various
     meta-markers and asserts that the sanitized output does not contain
     these markers, while still retaining the core conversational content.

Connects to:
    - app.py:
        - Imports and tests the `_sanitize_persona_text` function.
