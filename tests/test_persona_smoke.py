"""Persona smoke & variability tests.

Why: Ensure core persona generation pipeline produces responses, includes
required metadata, and exhibits variation for repeated inputs (addresses
prior repetition complaints).
Where: Executed by clever-ci.yml test stage; guards against regression in
persona/nlp integration.
How: Instantiate PersonaEngine, generate multiple responses for same
prompt, assert non-empty text, presence of mode/sentiment, and at least
two distinct first lines across attempts.

Connects to:
    - persona.py: PersonaEngine core functionality being tested
    - nlp_processor.py: NLP integration for response generation
    - pytest: Testing framework and assertions
