    """Validate code_health and component_graph presence in runtime_state.

    Why: Guard restored introspection enhancements (code health + dependency graph)
        so they remain available for tooling and UI overlays.
    Where: Part of test suite enforcing architectural transparency signals.
    How: Calls runtime_state() and asserts expected keys + structural fields.
