"""Tests for placeholder utility modules summarize_repo and self_fix.

Why:
    Ensure placeholder utilities maintain stable return contracts so downstream
    experimental integrations or UI components can rely on them without fear of
    silent shape changes.
Where:
    Runs in the standard pytest suite (tests/). Validates tools layer utilities
    that are currently stubs but documented and intended for future expansion.
How:
    Imports summarize() and plan_self_fixes() and asserts minimal structural
    invariants (types, required keys). Keeps assertions intentionally lenient to
    avoid over-constraining future evolution while still catching regressions.

Connects to:
    - tools/summarize_repo.py: summarize() API contract
    - utils/self_fix.py: plan_self_fixes() return shape
