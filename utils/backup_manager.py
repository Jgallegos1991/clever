"""
Backup Manager Module - Automated backup system for Clever AI project files.

Why: Provides reliable data protection through automated backup creation and
     retention management, ensuring project continuity and recovery capability
     while maintaining efficient storage usage through cleanup policies.

Where: Used by scheduled backup processes, deployment systems, and manual
       backup operations to protect Clever AI data and configuration.

How: Implements ZIP-based backup creation with timestamp naming, automatic
     cleanup of old backups, and configurable retention policies.

Connects to:
    - config.py:
        - Reads `config.ROOT_DIR` to determine the project's root path for creating backups.
    - (External Scripts):
        - Designed to be imported and used by automation scripts for scheduled backups or deployment workflows.
