offline_guard.py - Offline Guard Utility for Clever's Digital Sovereignty System

Why: Enforces strict offline operation by blocking all outbound network connections except loopback, ensuring compliance with Clever's digital sovereignty principles and maintaining complete local control of the cognitive partnership system.

Where: Used by app.py and system_validator.py to guarantee offline-only operation for all Clever AI components. Critical component of Clever's digital sovereignty architecture ensuring total privacy and control.

How: Monkey-patches socket.socket to raise errors on non-loopback connections, provides enable/disable toggles, and utility checks for network references in text.

File Usage:
    - Digital sovereignty: Primary enforcement mechanism for offline-only operation
    - Network isolation: Ensures no external network calls compromise privacy or control
    - System startup: Activated during app.py initialization to enforce offline mode
    - Input validation: Validates user input for network references to prevent external calls
    - Testing framework: Used by validation systems to test offline compliance
    - Security enforcement: Prevents accidental network leaks or external dependencies
    - Privacy protection: Ensures all cognitive partnership data stays local
    - Development safety: Protects against inadvertent external service calls during development

Connects to:
    - app.py: Core application integration for startup offline enforcement
        - `enable()` called at startup to enforce offline mode
        - `contains_network_reference()` used to validate user input against network terms
    - system_validator.py: System validation and testing integration
        - `enable()`, `disable()`, and `is_enabled()` used to test offline guard functionality
    - config.py: Configuration system integration for offline mode settings
    - evolution_engine.py: Learning system ensuring all data processing stays local
    - persona.py: Personality engine operating entirely offline for privacy
    - database.py: Local data persistence without external dependencies
    - nlp_processor.py: Natural language processing using only local models
    - .github/copilot-instructions.md: Digital sovereignty principles this utility enforces
    - SECURITY.md: Security policy supported by offline operation enforcement
