"""Local file search utility (offline, safe, single-root).

Why: Allow PersonaEngine to fulfill user intents like "find all python files
with memory in the name" or "locate pdf docs" by performing on-disk searches
within the project root only—aligning capability with responses.
Where: Invoked indirectly from PersonaEngine when detecting file search intent.
How: Provides search_files(patterns, max_results) supporting glob-style
patterns and simple substring filters. Enforces root confinement and ignores
venv, git, and large binary directories.

Connects to:
  - persona.py: Intent detection logic will call search_files
  - app.py: User queries routed through PersonaEngine
