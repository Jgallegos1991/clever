"""
Automated scheduler for sync and ingestion operations

Why: Provides automated background synchronization and file ingestion for
maintaining up-to-date knowledge base without manual intervention.
Where: Used as background service for continuous sync operations when 
AUTO_RCLONE_SCHEDULE is enabled in configuration.
How: Implements scheduling loop with configurable intervals for sync and
ingestion operations with graceful shutdown capabilities.

Connects to:
    - sync_tools.py: Remote synchronization operations
    - file_ingestor.py: Automated file processing and ingestion
    - config.py: Scheduling configuration and sync directories
    - Threading: Background service operation with stop events
